🍷 Wine Quality Prediction System

An end-to-end data science project that analyzes wine characteristics and predicts wine quality using machine learning, presented through an interactive Streamlit web application.
---
📌 Project Overview

Wine quality is influenced by multiple chemical properties such as acidity, alcohol content, pH level, and sulfur dioxide.
This project focuses on exploring these factors through data analysis, building machine learning models, and deploying the solution as a user-friendly web dashboard.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate a complete data science workflow — from raw data to a live, deployable application.
